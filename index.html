                 <h1>Why specter</h1> <hr> <p>Blogging using the technology available today is a chore. The blogging systems are incredibly complex. They need time to learn and often distract a writer from the actual process. Self hosting is not even considered. The technology should make writing and publishing on the web fun and easy. That is exactly what specter does by re-examining each and every process involved in blogging.</p> <h1>Polishing the writing tools</h1> <hr> <p>In any kind of blogging platform most of the time of the user is spend interacting with the writing tools and yet this is one area that is in dire need of an upgrade. WSYIWYG editors are good at what they do but they miss the point. A writer is concerned only with getting his thoughts across. He does not need to change the color of every second word or adjust the size of different paragraphs. A good editor is the most important component of any blogging tool. I recognize that and that is why before even starting work on specter I created an <a href="https://github.com/brislink/Abstract">opensource</a> web based editor.</p> <p>Say <a href="http://brislink.gihub.io/Abstract/">hello</a> to abstract a markdown based <a href="https://medium.com/look-what-i-made/20ecbb3fe5">preview on demand</a> editor. Some of the features of the editor are : </p> <ol><li><p>A distraction free editing environment</p></li><li><p>Uses markdown.</p></li><li><p>All drafts are saved locally in your browser.</p></li><li><p>Displays a preview when you want. No fooling around with two panels. Just a single writing area. If you want to see a preview just change focus.</p></li><li><p>Seamless switching between the writing view and the preview. When on writing view click anywhere else on screen to see a preview and when on preview click on the screen to start editing again. </p></li></ol> <h1>Easy setup</h1> <hr> <p>Specter is very easy to setup. All you need to do is install node js. Download elastic search and run specter. That's it. You are ready to blog now.</p> <h1>Easy administration</h1> <hr> <p>Specter has no administration window. There are no sessions. All users are maintained through a config file. To create a post just point the browser to "path where abstract is hosted"/ create . To edit a post point it to "path where abstract is hosted" / post-slug/ edit. But don't worry only the people that you have authorized can create or edit a post .The security is provided through the passwords that are created in the config file.</p> <h1>Easy customization</h1> <hr> <p>The front end of abstract is built using twitter bootstrap. This means that you are instantly able to choose from hundreds of themes that are built on top of it just by switching out the link tag. However if you feel inclined to create your own theme specter makes it trivial to do so. All you need to do is create a css file and swap it with the default bootstrap file that is provided.</p> <p>This customization extends beyond just themes. The views in specter are very simple and use mustache. By exploiting this fact you can change the entire structure of pages as you wish. </p> <p>In it's back end specter makes use of elastic search and node js. So if you are good with those technologies then you can easily customize it. The code base is quite small and for any complex task libraries are used. So not only is it very readable but very malleable as well.</p> <h1>Easy deployment</h1> <hr> <p>There are tonnes of free hosting providers for node js. All you need to do is run specter on one of their instances. Elastic search can be hosted on amazon or one of the various PAAS providers.</p> <h1>Easy discover-ability</h1> <hr> <p>In any blog self linking, related posts is a very important aspect. Once a reader is on your blog he should have an easy time in finding the content on your blog. Specter makes considerable improvements in this regard. It is built on top of elastic search and analyzes each post , it's author and tags to find related content.</p> <p>Once found the related items are presented in an easy to digest form after the post.</p> <h1>Open source</h1> <hr> <p>Yep specter is completely open source. Feel free to raise issues, provide patches and contribute to it it's development.</p> <p>Although specter is not available for use yet I am working very hard to make it happen.
